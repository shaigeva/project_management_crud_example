## Project Overview

A multi-tenant project management backend system supporting:
- Organizations (tenants) with isolated data
- Role-based access control (Admin, Project Manager, Write Access, Read Access)
- Projects containing tickets
- Epics that span multiple projects
- Comments on tickets
- Activity logs and audit trails with permission-based access
- Ticket workflows (V1: TODO/IN-PROGRESS/DONE, future: custom workflows)

## Feature: Stub Entity Template
**Status**: 🟢 4/4 requirements implemented (100%)
**Detail Spec**: See existing stub entity implementation
**Purpose**: Template/scaffolding for creating real entities
**Version**: N/A (scaffolding)

### Rationale
Provides a complete, working example of all architectural layers that can be copied and adapted for new entities.

### High-Level Requirements
- ✅ REQ-STUB-001: Create and retrieve stub entities
- ✅ REQ-STUB-002: List all stub entities
- ✅ REQ-STUB-003: Delete stub entities
- ✅ REQ-STUB-004: Handle not-found errors appropriately

**Completion Date**: 2024-01-20

## Feature: User Authentication
**Status**: 🟢 6/6 requirements implemented (100%)
**Detail Spec**: [detailed/auth_detailed_spec.md](detailed/auth_detailed_spec.md)
**Purpose**: Secure user authentication and session management
**Version**: V1

### Rationale
Users need secure authentication to access the system. Password-based login with bearer token sessions provides a balance of security and usability. Users receive generated passwords initially and can change them.

### High-Level Requirements
- ✅ REQ-AUTH-001: User login with username/password
- ✅ REQ-AUTH-002: Issue bearer token on successful login
- ✅ REQ-AUTH-003: Validate bearer token on protected endpoints
- ✅ REQ-AUTH-004: User can change their password
- ✅ REQ-AUTH-005: Token expiration and refresh
- ✅ REQ-AUTH-006: Handle authentication errors (invalid credentials, expired tokens)

**Notes**: Complete authentication feature with login, token-based sessions, password change, token expiration, and comprehensive error handling. Users can change passwords with strength validation (8+ chars, upper/lower/digit/special). Tokens remain stateless and valid after password changes.

---

## Feature: User Management
**Status**: 🟢 8/8 requirements implemented (100%)
**Detail Spec**: [detailed/users_detailed_spec.md](detailed/users_detailed_spec.md)
**Purpose**: Administer users within the system
**Version**: V1

### Rationale
Administrators need to create, update, and manage users. Users are created with generated passwords and assigned to organizations with specific roles.

### High-Level Requirements
- ✅ REQ-USER-001: Create user with generated password
- ✅ REQ-USER-002: Assign user to organization with role
- ✅ REQ-USER-003: Update user details
- ✅ REQ-USER-004: Deactivate/activate user
- ✅ REQ-USER-005: Delete user
- ✅ REQ-USER-006: List users (with filtering by org/role)
- ✅ REQ-USER-007: Retrieve user details
- ✅ REQ-USER-008: Handle user not found errors

**Notes**: Complete user CRUD with role-based authorization. Super Admin can manage all users; Org Admin can manage users in their organization. Password generation returns secure 12+ char passwords. Delete operation prevents removal of users who have created tickets.

---

## Feature: Multi-Tenancy (Organizations)
**Status**: 🟢 6/6 requirements implemented (100%)
**Detail Spec**: [detailed/organizations_detailed_spec.md](detailed/organizations_detailed_spec.md)
**Purpose**: Isolate data between different organizations (tenants)
**Version**: V1

### Rationale
The system supports multiple organizations (tenants) with complete data isolation. Each organization has its own projects, tickets, and users. Users can only access data within their organization.

### High-Level Requirements
- ✅ REQ-ORG-001: Create organization
- ✅ REQ-ORG-002: Retrieve organization details
- ✅ REQ-ORG-003: Update organization
- ✅ REQ-ORG-004: List organizations (admin only)
- ✅ REQ-ORG-005: Data isolation between organizations
- ✅ REQ-ORG-006: Users cannot access other organizations' data

**Notes**: Complete multi-tenant isolation implemented across all resources (projects, tickets, users). All list endpoints filter by user's organization. Cross-organization access attempts return 403 (projects/tickets) or 404 (users) to prevent information leakage. Super Admins can access all organizations. 14 comprehensive tests verify isolation boundaries.

**Detail Spec**: [detailed/rbac_detailed_spec.md](detailed/rbac_detailed_spec.md)
**Purpose**: Control access to resources based on user roles
**Version**: V1

### Rationale
Different users need different levels of access. The system supports five roles:
- **Super Admin**: Manage organizations, cross-organization access, create organization admins
- **Admin**: Full organization access, user management within organization
- **Project Manager**: Manage projects, tickets, assign users within organization
- **Write Access**: Create/update tickets and comments within organization
- **Read Access**: View tickets and comments only within organization

### High-Level Requirements
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-001: Super Admin can manage organizations and create organization admins
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-002: Super Admin can access all organizations
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-003: Admin role has full access within their organization
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-004: Project Manager can manage projects and tickets
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-005: Write Access users can create/update tickets
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-006: Read Access users can only view
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-007: Enforce permissions on all endpoints
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-008: Return 403 for unauthorized actions
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-009: Users see only data they have permission for
- 🔴 REQ-RBAC-010: Activity logs reflect user permissions

**Detail Spec**: [detailed/projects_detailed_spec.md](detailed/projects_detailed_spec.md)
**Purpose**: Organize work into projects
**Version**: V1

### Rationale
Projects (e.g., "Backend", "Frontend") are containers for tickets. Users with appropriate permissions can create and manage projects within their organization.

### High-Level Requirements
- ✅ REQ-PROJ-001: Create project within organization
- ✅ REQ-PROJ-002: Retrieve project by ID
- ✅ REQ-PROJ-003: List projects in organization

- ✅ REQ-PROJ-005: Delete project (with confirmation)
- ✅ REQ-PROJ-006: Projects are organization-scoped
- ✅ REQ-PROJ-007: Handle not-found errors
- ✅ REQ-PROJ-008: Handle validation errors
- 🔴 REQ-PROJ-009: Filter/search projects
- 🔴 REQ-PROJ-010: Archive projects (soft delete)

**Notes**: Core CRUD operations implemented with role-based authorization (Admin, Project Manager can create/update; Admin can delete). Organization scoping enforced - users can only access projects in their organization (Super Admin can access all). Filter/search and soft delete are pending future implementation.

Activity logging deferred to future implementation.
